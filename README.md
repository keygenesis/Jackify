# Jackify
A modlist installation and configuration tool for Wabbajack modlists on Linux

Jackify enables seamless installation and configuration of Wabbajack modlists on Linux systems, providing automated Steam shortcut creation and Proton prefix configuration.

### **Repository Migration Notice**

This repository has evolved from the original [Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux) guides and bash scripts into **Jackify** - a comprehensive Linux application for Wabbajack modlist management. 

**What changed?**
- **From**: Semi-automated bash scripts and step-by-step wiki guides
- **To**: A complete, automated Linux application with GUI and CLI interfaces
- **Why**: To provide a user-friendly application that removes the complexity of Wabbajack and modlist configuration

**Previous Content**: All original guides and scripts are preserved in the `Legacy/` directory. Jackify provides the same functionality with significantly improved automation and user experience.

---

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in Jackify - the next step, and a giant leap forward from my automated Wabbajack and modlist post-install scripts. So, Jackify - What is it?

Jackify is an almost Linux-native application written in Python, with a GUI produced with PySide6, and a full featured CLI interface if preferred. More info on the "almost" can be found in the full Introduction Wiki page. 

**Important Notes for Alpha Users:**
- This is the first alpha release - there WILL be bugs and issues that need to be resolved
- I am not a UI developer, so the current interface is functional but not polished
- Please report any issues you encounter to help improve the application

**Prefer Manual Installation?** If you'd rather use the proven bash scripts and manual guides that have been tested over many months, see the [Legacy Guides](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Jackify/wiki/Legacy-Wiki-Home) for the old installation methods.

Currently, there are two main functions that Jackify will perform at this stage of development:

- Install Wabbajack modlists using jackify-engine (more on jackify-engine in the full Introduction wiki linked above).
- Fully automate the configuration of the Steam shortcut, modlist paths, prefix components, launch options and various other tweaks required to run Wabbajack Modlists on Linux.
- With both of the above combined, Jackify provides an end-to-end modlist installation and configuration process, automatically.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Linux system (Most modern distributions supported)
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Steam installed and configured, Proton Experimental available
- **Nexus Mods Premium subscription** (required for automated downloads)
  - Non-premium support planned for future releases
- **FUSE** (required for AppImage execution)
  - Pre-installed on most Linux distributions
  - If AppImage fails to run, install FUSE using your distribution's package manager
- **Ubuntu/Debian only**: Qt platform plugin library
  - `sudo apt install libxcb-cursor-dev`
  - Required for Qt GUI to initialize properly

### Installation

```bash
# Download latest release from Nexus Mods
# Extract the Jackify.AppImage from the 7z archive
chmod +x Jackify.AppImage
./Jackify.AppImage
```

## Usage

For a complete step-by-step guide with screenshots, see the [User Guide](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Jackify/wiki/User-Guide).

### Quick Start

1. **Download**: Get the latest release from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1427?tab=files)
2. **Extract**: Unzip the .7z archive to get `Jackify.AppImage`
3. **Run**: `chmod +x Jackify.AppImage && ./Jackify.AppImage`
4. **Install**: Choose "Install a Modlist", select your game and modlist, configure directories and API key

**CLI Mode**: Run `./Jackify.AppImage --cli` for command-line interface

## Supported Games
- Skyrim Special Edition
- Fallout 4
- Fallout New Vegas
- Oblivion
- Starfield
- Enderal
- Other Games (Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3, and more - Download and Install only for now)

## Architecture
Jackify follows a clean separation between frontend and backend:

- Backend Services: Pure business logic with no UI dependencies
- Frontend Interfaces: CLI and GUI implementations using shared backend
- Native Engine: Powered by jackify-engine (custom fork of wabbajack-cli.exe) for optimal performance and compatibility
- Steam Integration: Direct Steam shortcuts.vdf manipulation for creating and modifying Steam shortcuts

## Configuration
Configuration files are stored in:

- Jackify Related: ~/Jackify/
- jackify-engine config: ~/.config/jackify/

## Development
Development and contribution guidelines coming soon.

## License
This project is licensed under the GPLv3 License - see the LICENSE file for details.

## Contributing
At this early stage of development, where basic functionality is the primary focus, I'd prefer to use GitHub Issues to suggest improvements, rather tha PRs. This will likely change in the future.

## Future Planned Features (not guaranteed)

- Continue to expand the supported games list for fully automated configuration
- Add full TTW+Modlist automation for TTW based modlists
- Replace the API Key requirement with a more secure OAuth based approach
- Add support for modding and modlist creation tools via a sister application or module
- Revise the GUI to be more refined
- Dark/Light theme support for the GUI
- Advanced logging and diagnostics - more detailed troubleshooting information
- Automatic dependency resolution - ensure all required tools and libraries are installed

## Support
- Issues: Report bugs and request features via GitHub Issues
- Documentation: See the Wiki for detailed guides
- Community: Join the community in the #unofficial-linux-help channel of the Official Wabbajack discord server - https://discord.gg/wabbajack

## Acknowledgments
- Wabbajack team for the modlist ecosystem, and wabbajack-cli.exe
- Linux and Steam Deck gaming communities
- Modlist Authors for their tireless effort in creating modlists in the first place
