##### Technical Details
- B8G8R8X8_UNORM format (88) is not supported by upstream Wabbajack's ToCompressionFormat; upstream appears to skip these files entirely.
- BCnEncoder-based format detection now used for all DDS files, ensuring correct handling and skipping of unsupported formats.
- Files detected as B8G8R8X8_UNORM now trigger copy logic instead of recompression, preventing unnecessary CPU-intensive work.
- Root cause: Previous logic attempted BC7 recompression on unsupported texture formats, causing major slowdowns.

This release completes the logging refactor that was blocking development workflow.

## v0.0.14 - User Experience & Steam Restart
**Release Date:** July 9, 2025

### User Experience

### User Experience
* All main workflows (Install, Tuxborn Auto, Configure New, Configure Existing) now use the updated SuccessDialog and display the correct game type.
* Improved field validation and error handling before starting installs.
* Changed text on pop up when user cancels workflow, was previously reusing Failed Install dialog.
* Upgraded jackify-engine to latest build (v.0.2.5)
