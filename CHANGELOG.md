The OAuth 2.0 authentication system has been fully developed and tested, but is temporarily disabled in v0.1.8 as we await approval from Nexus Mods for our OAuth application. The backend code remains intact and will be re-enabled immediately upon approval.

**Features (ready for deployment):**
- **Secure OAuth 2.0 + PKCE Flow**: Modern authentication to replace API key dependency
- **Encrypted Token Storage**: Tokens stored using Fernet encryption with automatic refresh
- **GUI Integration**: Clean status display on Install Modlist screen with authorize/revoke functionality
- **CLI Integration**: OAuth menu in Additional Tasks for command-line users
- **API Key Fallback**: Optional legacy API key support (configurable in Settings)
- **Unified Auth Service**: Single authentication layer supporting both OAuth and API key methods

**Current Limitation:** Awaiting Nexus approval for `jackify://oauth/callback` custom URI. Once approved, OAuth will be enabled as the primary authentication method with API key as optional fallback.

### Technical Details
- **Single Shortcut Creation Path**: All workflows now use `run_working_workflow()` → `create_shortcut_with_native_service()`
- **Service Layer Cleanup**: Removed dual codepath architecture in favor of proven automated workflows
- **Import Optimization**: Cleaned up unused service imports across GUI components

## v0.0.26 - Distribution Optimization and STL Integration Polish
**Release Date:** August 20, 2025

### Major Improvements
- **AppImage Size Optimization**: Implemented PyInstaller-style pre-filtering for PySide6 components, reducing AppImage size from 246M to 93M (62% reduction)
- **STL Distribution Integration**: Fixed SteamTinkerLaunch bundling and path detection for both PyInstaller and AppImage builds
- **Build Process Optimization**: Replaced inefficient "install everything then delete" approach with selective component installation

### Technical Improvements
- **Pre-filtering Architecture**: Only install essential PySide6 modules (QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets, QtNetwork, QtConcurrent, QtOpenGL) and their corresponding Qt libraries
- **Unified STL Path Detection**: Created `get_stl_path()` function for consistent STL location across all environments
- **AppImage Build Optimization**: Selective copying of Qt libraries, plugins, and data files instead of full installation
- **PyInstaller Integration**: Fixed STL bundling using `binaries` instead of `datas` for proper execute permissions

### Bug Fixes
- **AppImage STL Path Resolution**: Fixed STL not found errors in AppImage runtime environment
- **PyInstaller STL Permissions**: Resolved permission denied errors for bundled STL binary
- **Build Script Paths**: Corrected STL source path in AppImage build script
- **Icon Display**: Re-added PyInstaller icon configuration for proper logo display

### Performance Improvements
- **AppImage Size**: Reduced from 246M to 93M (smaller than PyInstaller's 120M)
- **Build Efficiency**: Eliminated wasteful post-deletion operations in favor of pre-filtering
- **Dependency Management**: Streamlined PySide6 component selection for optimal size

## v0.0.20 - GUI Regression Fixes
**Release Date:** July 23, 2025

### Bug Fixes

### Engine Updates
- **jackify-engine 0.2.11**: Performance improvements and bug fixes

#### Fixed
- **Accurate DDS Texture Format Detection and Skip Logic**
  - Replaced manual DDS header parsing with BCnEncoder-based format detection for improved accuracy and parity with upstream Wabbajack.
  - Added logic to skip recompression of B8G8R8X8_UNORM textures, copying them unchanged instead (hopefully matching upstream behavior).
  - Massive performance improvement: files that previously took 15+ minutes to process now copy in seconds.
  - Fixes major texture processing performance bottleneck in ESP-embedded textures.

##### Technical Details
- B8G8R8X8_UNORM format (88) is not supported by upstream Wabbajack's ToCompressionFormat; upstream appears to skip these files entirely.
- BCnEncoder-based format detection now used for all DDS files, ensuring correct handling and skipping of unsupported formats.
- Files detected as B8G8R8X8_UNORM now trigger copy logic instead of recompression, preventing unnecessary CPU-intensive work.
- Root cause: Previous logic attempted BC7 recompression on unsupported texture formats, causing major slowdowns.
